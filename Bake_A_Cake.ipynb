    "Without a doubt, **print()** are one of the most fundamental functions in virtually any programming language. Although it is fundamental, it is something that you absolutely need to master.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fundamentals of print() Statements\n",
    "Print statements are one of the most useful and fundamental operations in Python. We rarely want to print the output of every line of code that we write, and will even encounter several programs that do not print anything. The **print()** command helps us to manage what output gets printed, and what output should be suppressed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is printing?\n",
    "To clarify, to <em>print</em> simply means to <em>display</em>. When we call the <strong>print()</strong> function, we are telling Python to display something. When we call <strong>print()</strong> in Jupyter Notebook, by default, Python displays its results directly under the cell containing the <strong>print()</strong> statement.\n",

If another object is declared with the same name, it will cause conflict and the former object will be overwritten.\n",

This is good because these objects have no way to adversely affect the global environment (i.e. overwriting objects). We will call this island the function's environment. Oftentimes, we need something from the function's environment to interact with the global environment, and as the master of both environments, we have the ability to make this happen. In other words, at times we need something from the island to <strong>return</strong> to the global environment, and the syntax to accomplish this is, not surprisingly, named <strong>return</strong>.\n",
