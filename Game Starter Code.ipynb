In this starter code, we will assume that we have three rooms on our game map. The assignment requirements also specify that we have a fail function. Therefore, we will be creating a simple skeleton containing the following elements:\n* room_1\n* room_2\n* room_3\n* fail\n\nOur map can be visualized as follows:\n<br><br>\n\n~~~\n    room_1 --> room_2 --> room_3 (win)\n            |          |\n             `----------`------> fail\n~~~\n\n<br>\n\n## Part 1: Building up one room at a time (no fail function)"
